      <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her childhood years were one of the <strong>best experiences</strong> in her life <sup>1</sup>. She has a complete but not perfect family <sup>2</sup>. Her mother is a teacher and her father is a fisherman <sup>3</sup>. She has four siblings: three girls and one boy <sup>4</sup>. She's the second child <sup>5</sup>. Just like the other children, she can play freely <sup>6</sup>. They would not go home until the sun went down, so in the end, their mother hit them <sup>7</sup>. She experienced the whip of the belt and hanger, kneeling on the soybean with 2 or 3 books in both hands <sup>8</sup>. She even experienced being tied and standing with an ant for an hour <sup>9</sup>. But she understood all of that because it was part of how they disciplined the children by their parents <sup>10</sup>. Like other children, they need to sleep every 12 o'clock and the rule of their guardian is that those who won't sleep can't play outside at 4 pm <sup>11</sup>. Of course, she was stubborn then, so she pretended to be sleeping <sup>12</sup>. When it was 3 in the afternoon, they were given 3 pesos, and then they were to buy a snack with the amount of 1 peso each from the store <sup>13</sup>. They were happy and content with it <sup>14</sup>. When it was 4 pm, they could play outside, and she had a lot of playmates <sup>15</sup>. Patintero, tag, Chinese garter, hide and seek, and tumbang preso: she has experience of playing all of those <sup>16</sup>. Patintero is her favorite game <sup>17</sup>. <dfn>Patintero</dfn> also known as harangang-taga or tubigan, is a traditional Filipino children's game. Along with tumbang preso, it is one of the most popular outdoor games played by children in the Philippines <sup>18</sup>. </p></blockquote>

      <p><blockquote>Her mother taught them how to do the household chores because she was the second eldest, so when their mother was still in school, they used to wipe the windows, sweep the floor, wash the dishes, do the laundry, and water her mother's plants <sup>19</sup>. Then every vacation, their aunt borrowed her and her cousin to go to Manila to be playmates with their aunt's son <sup>20</sup>. She's enjoying it because it's the only time she's experienced swimming in a swimming pool and tasting different foods there <sup>21</sup>. Every Christmas party is the only occasion that they can buy a new pair of clothes, and they are very thankful that their mother somehow buys them new clothes <sup>22</sup>. Then, at every Christmas party their mother attends in school, she takes her and her eldest sister, and their mother's co-teachers give them a gift or money <sup>23</sup>. Every Christmas and New Year, they are very happy because their relatives come home from Manila and give them a lot of Christmas presents and money <sup>24</sup>. She's not that intelligent <sup>25</sup>. She studies by herself and answers the lectures by herself <sup>26</sup>. Sometimes she can't disturb her mother to teach her because she notices that her mother is tired from school <sup>27</sup>. She was a character awardee when she graduated from elementary <sup>28</sup>.</blockquote></p> </div>

        <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her teenage years, there was a lot happening <sup>1</sup>. They say that <i>high school life </i> is one of the best things that you've experienced in your whole existence <sup>2</sup>. She's just a typical high school student studying to graduate and secretly peeking at her crush <sup>3</sup>. At her junior high school, she participated in every event and had a dance performance <sup>4</sup>. She even tried to participate in sports events like running, triple jump, and long jump <sup>5</sup>. But maybe she's not destined for it and her illness can't take it <sup>6</sup>. In her grade-eight days, she met some wonderful people <sup>7</sup>. They became her friends, who are still her friends. There were five in the group <sup>8</sup>. <i>She really adored and trusted them so much, and they really supported each other </i><sup>9</sup>. They always go to church every Sunday <sup>10</sup>. Grade 10 is one of the most memorable parts of being a junior high student <sup>11</sup>. Her mother is her adviser <sup>12</sup>. It's so awkward for her that every time her mother gets mad and yells in front of the whole class <sup>13</sup>. In the armchairs, she zipped her lips and bowed her head <sup>14</sup>. She even tried to play Dota even though she didn't know how to play it <sup>15</sup>. It's because of her best friend, who is in love with her crush, that she just followed and supported her <sup>16</sup>. They parted ways in senior high school because they took different strands <sup>17</sup>. She chose the <abbr title="Humanities and Social Sciences">HUMSS</abbr> strand <sup>18</sup>. The <abbr title="Humanities and Social Sciences">HUMSS</abbr> Senior High School strand is designed for students who intend to take up journalism, communication arts, liberal arts, education, and other social-science related courses in college <sup>19</sup>. It's related to her chosen course that's why she chose it <sup>20</sup>.</blockquote></p>

    <p><blockquote>For her, one of the best experiences of being a senior higshschool student was when she became an honor student and encountered a solid section that was very supportive of each other and her additional friends <sup>21</sup>. They used to hang out after class or in their free time, riding motorcycles and leaving no one behind <sup>22</sup>. She learned to leave home without telling her parents where she was going <sup>23</sup>. Until they had an accident, and she didn't even tell her parents <sup>24</sup>. In looking for a school to attend college at, she submitted a paper and took an exam at Batangas State University and Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Manila <sup>25</sup>. She didn't attend their Senior High School Prom because it was her entrance examination into <abbr title="Polytechnic University of the Philippines">PUP</abbr><sup>26</sup>. She really wanted to experience a prom because, in their junior high school, they never had a chance to attend a prom night <sup>27</sup>. But also, she wants to take the opportunity to take the examination at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines <sup>28</sup>. She passed in <abbr title="Batangas State University">BSU</abbr> but was not so lucky in <abbr title="Polytechnic University of the Philippines"> PUP</abbr> <sup>26</sup>. Still, for her, it's been a great experience <sup>29</sup>. She was stubborn back then when she was in senior high, but she <strong>still managed to graduate with an award</strong><sup>30</sup>. Her teenage life is not that bad <sup>31</sup>. </blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the stage where you realize that you need to decide carefully for your future <sup>1</sup>. After she passed the exam in <abbr title="Batangas State University">BSU</abbr>, her aunt offered her that she was going to support her studies at <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> and, in return, she would help in the house and take care of her aunt's sons <sup>2</sup>. It was a great opportunity for her, so she agreed with it <sup>3</sup>. She changed her mind about choosing the course to take, and she chose <abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Information Technology">BSIT</abbr> <sup>4</sup>. She was completely unaware of the course.She doesn't know much about computers and coding, unlike her other classmates who already have coding backgrounds <sup>5</sup>. Manila is different from the province where she grew up, so she doesn't know how to interact with her classmates <sup>6</sup>. But she made friends, but she was often alone <sup>7</sup>. She can say that the section that she belongs to is also a great section because they help each other <sup>8</sup>. One time, she tried to join them in billiards and never repeated it <sup>9</sup>. She was once a little offended when her classmate told her that she was an introvert <sup>10</sup>. She's not like that, she just doesn't want to join them, and she has to go back to her aunt's office right away <sup>11</sup>. First year, second semester, new classmates again <sup>12</sup>. She's alone and still quiet on the side <sup>13</sup>. The only places she went to were the library and office <sup>14</sup>. It's fine with her because she only has to finish her studies at a university <sup>15</sup>. One of the best experiences in college life is the field trip on a subject <sup>16</sup>. </blockquote></p>

On the way home, they were very happy because someone was singing and having fun on the inside of the bus <sup>18</sup>. Then the pandemic broke out, it was her worst year <sup>19</sup>. She stopped for a year because she thought the pandemic would end immediately, but it didn't <sup>20</sup>. Her parents scolded her <sup>21</sup>. She doesn't like online classes because she feels she hasn't learned anything <sup>22</sup>. But she realized that a year had been wasted <sup>23</sup>. She also regretted that if she continued she would graduate soon <sup>24</sup>. But now she's enrolling again to continue her studies <sup>25</sup>. She also learned the routine of online classes <sup>26</sup>. She is still fighting for her dreams <sup>27</sup>.</blockquote></p>
